    <h2>ðŸ“½ Demo Workflow â€” ElectroMotorCalc-Datasheet-Manager</h2>

    <p>The journey begins with a <strong>simple CSV upload</strong> â€” a file containing the <em>basic data</em> of many motors. With one click, the application loads this foundation for the work ahead.</p>

    <p>From here, <strong>you set the configuration</strong>: choose the voltage, motor length, speed, torque, pulse duration, and temperature limits. These choices define exactly what you want to see, whether youâ€™re <strong>the development team preparing performance tests</strong> or <strong>the constructor crafting a datasheet for a customer</strong>.</p>

    <p>Once submitted, the application <strong>takes over</strong> â€” instantly performing the complex calculations needed for <em>advanced parameters</em>. No more manual calculations, no more guesswork. In seconds, the <strong>development team</strong> has the accurate theoretical values they need to prepare prototypes, and the <strong>constructor</strong> has the data to start building or documenting.</p>

    <p>If you want to <strong>focus on just one motor configuration</strong>, you can open it in a dedicated table that shows <em>all its calculated data in one place</em>. Itâ€™s perfect for diving deep into a single case without distractions.</p>

    <p>Or maybe you donâ€™t need <em>everything</em> â€” just a few key metrics? The app lets you <strong>select exactly the parameters you care about</strong> from a list, so your table shows <em>only</em> what matters to you.</p>

    <p>And because work is never linear, <strong>the results table is fully interactive</strong> â€” copy, paste, delete, adjust â€” all without breaking the calculation process. The <strong>constructor</strong> can compare designs, tweak parameters, and make notes, all directly in the app.</p>

    <p>When the results are ready, they can be <strong>exported to Excel</strong> in a single click. Whether itâ€™s for further analysis, sharing with colleagues, or archiving, the data is ready to go.</p>

    <p>For more visual insights, the app can <strong>generate a representative motor function diagram</strong> for the selected configuration. This is invaluable for both <strong>engineering analysis</strong> and <strong>customer-facing datasheets</strong>.</p>

    <p>If you need to explore possibilities, the <strong>full variation analysis</strong> mode will calculate <em>every possible setup</em> for your chosen motor. The <strong>development team</strong> can then compare results side-by-side before even touching the lab, saving time and avoiding unnecessary tests.</p>

    <p>But hereâ€™s where the magic really happens: the <strong>constructor</strong> can upload the companyâ€™s <em>commercial datasheet template</em>, and the application will <strong>auto-fill it</strong> â€” parameters, diagrams, values â€” ready to hand to the customer.</p>

    <p>For more technical needs, the <strong>advanced datasheet generator</strong> takes it further â€” producing a datasheet with <strong>mandatory test parameters</strong> required for operation and safety, again from a template you provide.</p>

    <p>And finally, with a single click, the <strong>one-click all-motor calculation</strong> processes <em>every motor in every configuration</em>. Itâ€™s the ultimate dataset for <strong>development, research, and optimization</strong> â€” all in one place, without touching a calculator.</p>
