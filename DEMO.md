## ðŸ“½ Demo Workflow â€” ElectroMotorCalc-Datasheet-Manager

The journey begins with a **simple CSV upload** â€” a file containing the *basic data* of many motors.  
With one click, the application loads this foundation for the work ahead.  

From here, **you set the configuration**: choose the voltage, motor length, speed, torque, pulse duration, and temperature limits.  
These choices define exactly what you want to see, whether youâ€™re **the development team preparing performance tests** or **the constructor crafting a datasheet for a customer**.  

Once submitted, the application **takes over** â€” instantly performing the complex calculations needed for *advanced parameters*.  
No more manual calculations, no more guesswork. In seconds, the **development team** has the accurate theoretical values they need to prepare prototypes, and the **constructor** has the data to start building or documenting.  

If you want to **focus on just one motor configuration**, you can open it in a dedicated table that shows *all its calculated data in one place*.  
Itâ€™s perfect for diving deep into a single case without distractions.  

Or maybe you donâ€™t need *everything* â€” just a few key metrics?  
The app lets you **select exactly the parameters you care about** from a list, so your table shows *only* what matters to you.  

And because work is never linear, **the results table is fully interactive** â€” copy, paste, delete, adjust â€” all without breaking the calculation process.  
The **constructor** can compare designs, tweak parameters, and make notes, all directly in the app.  

When the results are ready, they can be **exported to Excel** in a single click.  
Whether itâ€™s for further analysis, sharing with colleagues, or archiving, the data is ready to go.  

For more visual insights, the app can **generate a representative motor function diagram** for the selected configuration.  
This is invaluable for both **engineering analysis** and **customer-facing datasheets**.  

If you need to explore possibilities, the **full variation analysis** mode will calculate *every possible setup* for your chosen motor.  
The **development team** can then compare results side-by-side before even touching the lab, saving time and avoiding unnecessary tests.  

But hereâ€™s where the magic really happens:  
The **constructor** can upload the companyâ€™s *commercial datasheet template*, and the application will **auto-fill it** â€” parameters, diagrams, values â€” ready to hand to the customer.  

For more technical needs, the **advanced datasheet generator** takes it further â€” producing a datasheet with **mandatory test parameters** required for operation and safety, again from a template you provide.  

And finally, with a single click, the **one-click all-motor calculation** processes *every motor in every configuration*.  
Itâ€™s the ultimate dataset for **development, research, and optimization** â€” all in one place, without touching a calculator.

This is **ElectroMotorCalc-Datasheet-Manager** â€” a tool that doesnâ€™t just calculate; it empowers both the **engineering team** and the **constructor** to work faster, smarter, and with complete confidence.
